Engineering materials
The structure of our robot is made of a kit of makeblock mbot, but only the structure, the main and most important component of the robot is a raspberry pi 4, also we use two ultrasonic sensors, a dc motor, and a servo motor for direction.

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2023.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains a photo of the team 
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is were is located the main code wich is the movement of the robot.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Introduction

_This part must be filled by participants with the technical clarifications about the code: which modules the code consists of, how they are related to the electromechanical components of the vehicle, and what is the process to build/compile/upload the code to the vehicleâ€™s controllers._

## How to prepare the repo based on the template

_Remove this section before the first commit to the repository_

1. Clone this repo by using the `git clone` functionality.
2. Remove `.git` directory
3. [Initialize a new public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new) by following instructions from "create a new repository on the command line" section (appeared after pressing "Create repository" button).
