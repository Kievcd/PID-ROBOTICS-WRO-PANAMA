Engineering materials
The structure of our robot is made of a kit of makeblock mbot, but only the structure, the main and most important component of the robot is a raspberry pi 4, also we use two ultrasonic sensors, a dc motor, and a servo motor for direction.

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2023.
